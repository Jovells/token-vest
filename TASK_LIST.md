# Token Vesting Kernel & Claim Contract Migration Task List

## Overview
Transitioning from a **Transaction Limit Kernel** (daily donation limits) to a comprehensive **Token Vesting System** with:
- **TokenVestingKernel**: Manages one vesting schedule per token (token address as identifier)
- **TokenClaimContract**: Separate contract for claiming vested tokens using kernel verification
- **Admin Interface**: Open frontend for managing vesting schedules
- **Multi-Token Support**: Works with any ERC20 token
- **Eligible Addresses**: Only specific addresses can claim tokens per vesting schedule
- **Simple Architecture**: One schedule per token applies to eligible users only

## Simplified Architecture Analysis

### New Smart Contract Architecture
1. **TokenVestingKernel**: On-chain kernel for vesting logic
   - One vesting schedule per token address
   - Token address serves as the schedule identifier
   - Anyone can create/edit schedules for any token
   - Each schedule includes a list of eligible addresses
   - Returns vested amounts for verification (only for eligible addresses)

2. **TokenClaimContract**: Replaces LimitedDonation.sol
   - Uses KRNL integration with TokenVestingKernel
   - Holds vested tokens for distribution
   - Tracks token deposits per user per token
   - Only depositors can withdraw their deposited tokens
   - Verifies claims through kernel before releasing tokens
   - Respects eligible addresses from vesting schedules

3. **VestedToken**: New ERC20 token (optional - system supports any ERC20)
   - Demo token for the vesting system
   - Proper naming and metadata for vesting use case

### Frontend Requirements
- **User Interface**: Claim vested tokens, view schedules by token (only if eligible)
- **Admin Interface**: Create/manage vesting schedules per token with eligible addresses (open access)
- **Multi-Token Support**: Display schedules for different ERC20 tokens
- **Eligibility Management**: Add/remove eligible addresses for each token schedule
- **Progress Visualization**: Vesting timelines per token for eligible users
